# NaoBlocks.Net

Welcome to the NaoBlocks.Net project.

I'd like to tell you about how wonderful the project is, but it is a research project. We are in the process of tidying things up and making them better. But for now, this project is still very much a work in progress...

## Editors

NaoBlocks.Net currently offers two editors.

### Blockly (Angular) Editor

The Blockly editor is a Scratch-like programming environment. The user will need to drag and drop blocks on the workspace:

### Tangible Editor

The Tangible editor uses computer vision to detect physical (tangible) blocks. These are recognised and displayed in the workshop:
