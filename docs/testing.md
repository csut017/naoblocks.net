# Unit Tests

NaoBlocks.Net comes with a suite of unit tests to test the core functionality.

## Code Coverage

To generate the coverage reports run `generateCoverage.cmd` *(**note:** this only works on a Windows OS)*.

`generateCoverage.cmd` will execute all the unit tests in the solution, generate the coverage report and open the report in the default browser.

# HTTP Tests

NaoBlocks.Net also has a set of HTTP tests. These tests are designed to be executed in Visual Studio Code using the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).
