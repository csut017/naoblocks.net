# NaoBlocks Papers

NaoBlocks.Net is a .Net Core version of NaoBlocks. NaoBlocks was originally written in GoLang, but ported to .Net Core due to a lack of Go components for some desired functionality.

# RoboLang Papers

RoboLang is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) that was designed to simplify the programming of robots. It is used internally within NaoBlocks.Net (and NaoBlocks) to simplify the transfer and storage of programs.
