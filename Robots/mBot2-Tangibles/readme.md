# mBot2 (Tangibles)

This folder contains the mBot2 robot client for tangibles.

This code runs directly on the robot. It scans for command cards and executes them directly. The only server interaction is via logging.

This code was originally written as part of Te haerenga a Kupe, Kupe's Journey project.
